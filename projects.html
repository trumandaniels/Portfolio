          This project visualizes student absenteeism data across the United
          States. The dataset includes information on absentee rates (15+
          absences per year) by state, categorized by disability status and
          race. The data is represented on an interactive map, where users can
          explore absentee rates across different states and demographics.

          This project visualizes the trends in H1B visa approvals in the United
          States over time using Seaborn. The graph shows how approval rates
          have changed year by year, offering insights into patterns and
          fluctuations in the number of H1B visas issued. The dataset used is
          sourced from publicly available government records, and the analysis
          is conducted in Python, utilizing Pandas for data manipulation and
          Seaborn for effective data visualization.

          This project explores the relationship between shot efficiency and
          quality in the NBA, with a focus on using shot proximity as a key
          factor for coaching strategies. By analyzing player shot data, I
          evaluated how shot location, type, and context affect overall shooting
          performance. The findings aim to provide insights for coaches on
          optimizing shot selection, improving team strategies, and enhancing
          player development based on shot quality metrics.
